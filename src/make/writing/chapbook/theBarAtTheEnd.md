# The Bar at the End
Take it - the lip ring
of life's fumbling worm
dragged down to hell

Let's rip and rally
Life's Ends
but we go on on
currents of passion and pain
memmories of currents and charges

Fall into the pattern - swimming
a fractal of self
And questions
giving way to scents
and speculation

You are an ending. Punctuation.
The fruiting body of a new paragraph
on reality
It's mystery is you
Inside a room
Smiling at two friends who know
You are the life of the party
and a fan of trees
