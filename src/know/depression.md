# Depression

## How to Create an "upward spiral"

### 1. Exercise
 - Produces
  - Endorphins
  - endocannabinoids
 - Raises levels of
  - neuro growth factor
  
### 2. Make Decisions
 - Make decisions for 'Good Enough'
     - Activates Pre-frontal Cortex
     - enhances perception related to goal
     - calms the limbic system (if decision is SMART)

 - Focusing on what you "really value" reduces stress response
 - Deciding increases enjoyment
      You are at your happiest when you set a goal, pursue it, and achieve it.

      Depression of the frontal limbic area means you cannot connect future actions to today's actions. 

      Result: short-term pleasure seeking

 - Choosing increases reward and changes tase
     #? Does prolonged rejection of a choice decrease interest?

 - We are at our best when moving towards a long-term goal we feel is achievable.
