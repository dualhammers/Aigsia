# Neuroscience of Mood, Behavior, and the Self

## Emotions, Habits, and Conscious Thought Overview

### What is an emotion

An emotion is a neurochemical event in certain portions of the brain we call the limbic system. You feel these chemical changes as differences in your body. We call this feeling an emotion.

Emotions are an event our body reacts to. Events are a reaction to events.

Emotions can be triggered by stimulus - both itnernal and external.

Emotions cannot be conciously controlled. They are decided on by the brain before we have thoughts about them.

- You are experiencing anxiety BEFORE you think an anxious thought.

Only the conditions surrounding emotions can be affectecd.

Emotions can affect other parts of the brain. They influence behavior primiarly thorugh habits.

Emotional regulation is central to mental health. 


### What is a habit

Habits are behaviors we have memorized by encoding them in our striatum. 

Habits use far less energy than actions still being memorized, and the longer a habit is performed the easier it is to perform. Your body has a preference for falling back on habits rather than performing new behaviors. 

Habits can be associated with certain stimulus and certain emotions. 

Habits can be triggered by emotions and create emotional states

Habits are how we do most things. 


### What is concious thought

Concious control, concious thought, the rational mind. All aspects of the self primarily governed by the cortex.

Self-awareness is related to but also larger than the pre-frontal cortex

Choosing to work on a task with a goal in mind is an act of concious control which activates the Task Positive Network in the brain.

Articulating to yourself or to another person that you are having an emotion is an act of concious control.


## Emotional Regulation
Emotions are the response to things and we respond to them. Emotions can trigger behavior which triggers new emotions.

Emotional regulation is achieved in two main ways:

1. Shifting the habituated response to emotions so that the response is beneficial to the person and produces subsequent positive emotions.

2. Changing the neurochemistry of the brain such that emotional states are primarily positive


### Habits of Emotional Regulation

#### Mindfulness and Meditation

Meditation change connections in the Default Mode Network of the brain. These changes seem to regulate emotions over the long-term.

Mindfulness and meditation are related in that they are both acts of attention.

In meditation, the practiciner focuses on something (a thought, a sound, a physical act) and, when the mind begins to wander, choosing to return attention to that chosen object.

Over time, this strengthens the ability of the mind to focus.  

Mindfulness is an act of self-awareness when experiencing an emotion. 

- Acknowledge to the self 'I am having this emotion'
- Focusing attention on the individual physical senstations occuring
- Focusing attention on the details of the envrionment
- Focusing attention on the particulars of the task at hand

Both of these behaviors decrease activity in the Default Mode Network.
